# Fungal Growth Classification

'fungalGrowthClassification' is an automated R code used to perform Machine Learning (ML) experiments and their automated analysis, including plots and tables. Thus, this repository includes all the necessary files to reproduce our paper *``Classification of the growth level of fungal colonies in solid medium: a machine learning approach''*.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as follows:
- **data/**: contains all the original data (images) and datasets generated during ML experiments;
- **R/**: contains some useful R scripts that automate some behavior or extract statistics. There is also a configuration file in it;
- **results/**: contains all the generated results (in .RData objects, text files, or tables);
- **plots/**: contains the papers' figures generated by the exploratory data analysis or the results' automated analysis;
- **scripts/**: contains some scripts we designed to perform experiments (preprocessing images, and so on);
- **test/**: some programming tests
- **old/**: old files we coded using different R packages and outdated

## General Instructions

There are three main and important files:

- **01_ExploratoryAnalysis.R**: perform the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the generated datasets;
- **02_MLExperimentsMLR.R**: perform classification experiments running several algorithms in different learning tasks, checking different properties available in the dataset;
- **03_ResultsAnalysis.R**: perform the automated analysis of the results obtained by the task above.

You can run all three scripts separately, but there is a *natural* dependency between scripts 02_ and 03_. The automated analysis will only generate figures if ML experiments have had executed; otherwise, it will fail.


## Running the code

To run these scripts, please, use the following commands:

```R
Rscript 01_ExploratoryAnalysis.R
# Rscript 02_MLExperimentsMLR.R
# Rscript 03_ResultsAnalysis.R
```

Just use the commented commands to run script 02_ or 03_.
